Work to the homework:
1. Studied and experimented METEOR with exact word match, stemmed word match and synonym word match.
2. Experimented the outcome of preprocess methods, including convert to lowercase, remove word "the" and remove punctuation, and chunk penalty.
3. Write a part of project report.
 
The commit identifiers from SFU GitLab:

add stemmed match, synonym match, commit ID: 8d719fc2
add chunk penalty, commit ID: 104bb0e4
