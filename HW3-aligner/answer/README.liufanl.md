Work to the homework:
1. Write a basic version of align.py for baseline and code review.
2. Research several methods to improve result, including add null words to the source sentence, smoothing translation counts and initialize the parameters with log-likelihood-ration.
 
The commit identifiers from SFU GitLab: 
liufanl align.py for baseline, commit ID: c36a52f1
testing code for smooth and null word, commit ID: ffb2278f
initialize parameters with LLR, commit ID: ae4568c1
