# Personal contribution

1. IBM1 Model design and code
2. Code IBM model2 with p(f|e) and p (e|f)
   Then calculate by intersection. I get 0.38 from leadboard named “想回杭州吃鸡腿”
3. Discussing the implement in using joint train.
4. I try to USE IBM model 2 joint train + intersection to get 0.27. Currently, I cannot get the result because of the leadboard. Still trying.
